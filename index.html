		<p><font size = "+1">Welcome to my page! I am Sean Dang and I am currently a freshman at California State University Long Beach. I am currently majoring in Computer Science. Some things
					I do in my free time is I like to play games like Valorant and Call Of Duty with my friends, reasearch and learn more things about cars, and hang out with my friends whenever
					I get the chance. One hobby of mine is anything about cars! Every aspect about cars interest me, especially the design and engineering that goes into making a standard car faster,
					and pushing its limits to the max. Aside from my obsession with cars, I also enjoy running and exercising. In high school, I ran cross country and long distace track for all 4
					years for the Marina team. Although I was not the best, the friends and connections I made over time made it worth it. Some other extra curricular things I did in high school was 
					play ping pong with my ping pong club. I also occasionally helped out my church with retreats over the weekends.
